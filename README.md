[Modular Programming with JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/modular-programming-javascript?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785880650) by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)


The codebase related to this book consists of the following:

- code snippets

- application code

For chapters 1, 2 and 3, you can find the related code for each chapter in codeSnippets.txt.
You can either embed the code in a simple html page and run it in the browser or use sites such as http://jsbin.com to run the code samples.

For the rest of the chapters (except chatper 7 which has no project code associated with it), you should use an IDE with a built in web server, such as Brackets or VScode. The code for these chapters is in their related ImagesIncApp folder. Each chapter project builds on the previous chapter's porject but adds new features. You only need to load the index.html in the browser using your IDE to run the project.

The final project code is in Chapter 10.

There is no server side code associated with this book as we have focused on a client side application.

Good luck and all the best!
